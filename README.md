ASSESSMENT 4 data

In the main directory the rodent_rag1.fasta dataset can be found, as well as the ED_His, which contains the ED Scores histogram.

The trees, distorsion plots and the R script used, as well as a copy of the workspace, can be found in the asses4 subfolder.

Other files not specified are part of the mrBayes analysis atempt.

The mlm_asses4.docx is not the definitive report, for some reason it can't be deleted from the repository, the complete report is the one submited by MyDundee.
